  This is an assumption that you might still want to add an additional quotation for a different carrier.
  This would be a product & design decision that would need to made here.
  However since this is a test i've decided to allow this but I'd need more context in real life
  
  Other options to this would be:
    1. Always regenerate -> Carrier prices could have been reduced or increased during this time frame so going to steer clear.
    2. Silently ignore -> Only generate quotes for new carriers and keep any existing quotes the same.
        - This might give clients or users the impression they are getting a new quotation for a particular carrier, which could cause confusion.
    3. âœ… Error -> Error if we've already quoted for the same request carrier, will avoid variations in price and avoid confusion.
